# Evaluate the model inputs

Once you have bound values to a model's inputs and outputs, you are ready to evaluate the model's inputs and get its predictions.

To run the model, you call any of the **Evaluate*** methods on your [LearningModelSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning.learningmodelsession). You can use the [LearningModelEvaluationResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning.learningmodelevaluationresult) to look at the output features.

## Example

In the following example, we run an evaluation on the session, passing in the binding and a unique correlation ID. Then we parse the output as a list of probabilities, match it to a list of labels for the different things our model can recognize, and write the results to the console:

```cs
// How many times an evaluation has been run
private int runCount = 0;

private void EvaluateModel(
    LearningModelSession session, 
    LearningModelBinding binding,
    string outputName,
    List<string> labels)
{
    // Process the frame with the model
    var results = 
        await session.EvaluateAsync(binding, $"Run {++runCount}");

    // Retrieve the results of evaluation
    var resultTensor = results.Outputs[outputName] as TensorFloat;
    var resultVector = resultTensor.GetAsVectorView();

    // Find the top 3 probabilities
    List<(int index, float probability)> indexedResults = new List<(int, float)>();

    for (int i = 0; i < resultVector.Count; i++)
    {
        indexedResults.Add((index: i, probability: resultVector.ElementAt(i)));
    }

    // Sort the results in order of highest probability
    indexedResults.Sort((a, b) =>
    {
        if (a.probability < b.probability)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else if (a.probability > b.probability)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    });

    // Display the results
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine(
            $"\"{labels[indexedResults[i].index]}\" with confidence of {indexedResults[i].probability}");
    }
}
```

## Device removal

If the device becomes unavailable, or if you'd like to use a different device, you must close the session and create a new session.

In some cases, graphics devices might need to be unloaded and reloaded, as explained in the [DirectX documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/gaming/handling-device-lost-scenarios).

When using Windows ML, you'll need to detect this case and close the session. To recover from a device removal or re-initialization, you'll create a new session, which triggers the device selection logic to run again.

The most common case where you will see this error is during [LearningModelSession.Evaluate](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning.learningmodelsession.evaluate). In the case of device removal or reset, [LearningModelEvaluationResult.ErrorStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning.learningmodelevaluationresult.errorstatus) will be [DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-error) or [DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_RESET](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-error).
